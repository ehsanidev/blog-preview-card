## Overview

### The Challenge

The challenge was to build a responsive blog preview card component that looks great on all screen sizes. The design was provided by Frontend Mentor, and the goal was to replicate it as closely as possible using HTML and CSS.

**Requirements:**
- Build a responsive blog preview card.
- Match the design provided in the style guide.
- Ensure accessibility and semantic HTML.

## My Process

### Built With

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup for better accessibility.
- **CSS3**: Custom properties, Flexbox, and Grid for layout.
- **Google Fonts**: Used the `Figtree` font for typography.
- **Mobile-First Workflow**: Designed for mobile devices first, then scaled up for larger screens.

### What I Learned

- **CSS Custom Properties**: Used CSS variables (`:root`) to manage colors and make the code more maintainable.
- **Responsive Design**: Practiced creating a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Accessibility**: Improved my understanding of semantic HTML and proper use of `alt` attributes for images.
- **CSS Pseudo-Elements**: Used `::before` to create a shadow effect for the card.

### Continued Development

Areas I want to continue focusing on in future projects:
- **Advanced CSS Animations**: Adding subtle animations to improve user experience.
- **CSS Grid**: Exploring more complex grid layouts.
- **JavaScript Integration**: Adding interactivity to static components.
